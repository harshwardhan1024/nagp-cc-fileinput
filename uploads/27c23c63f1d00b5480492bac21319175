After working as a full-stack developer for 5 years in leading tech organisations, I've decided to explore more opportunities to feed my passion and love for engineering through Upwork.

For now, I am looking for smaller jobs to kickstart my journey and build some reputation on the platform.

Here is some of work:

- Developed invoicing pipeline using Azure functions and Stripe
- Developed boxplot generation pipeline using .NET WebJobs
- Built and implemented narrow integration testing strategy for which would work locally and in CI pipeline
- Built CI and CD pipelines using Azure pipelines
- Extensively worked on RESTful Web APIs
- Have good working knowledge and experience of Azure
- Practioner of DDD and TDD


I have attached my resume for you review and would welcome the chance to speak with you regarding the project.

Thanks and Regards,
Harshwardhan Singh
